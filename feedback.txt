1. Small things:
	a. Source for the gamma energies
	b. Source for the physical form
	c. You should do a bit more labeling, like which plots are physical vs log poly
	d. What is the "absolute percent" difference? It is a percent or absolute?
	
2. It's always hard to check other people's work. It's even harder here because most of the work is tucked away in the ASA file. I'm 
   not really going into those functions at all. If you want a second set of eyes there, let me know and I'll look.
   
3. Be careful how you use these chi-sq values in the paper.  Chi-sq/DF is supposed to be a distribution around 1, so chi-sq should be 
   a distribution around DF (here the number of data points). The reason that yours are so incredibly small (10^-6) is likely 
   that the data points are highly correlated (maybe an indication of correlations between the counts, or that the activity 
   uncertainties should be larger than they are?). Comparing the values to each other is fine but I would not try to draw any other 
   conclusions.
   
4. The plots for the predicted residuals are really hard to understand. There are too many points/lines to do the color coding that
   I had done before, but maybe you can do something sort of similar? Like only color code the data points that make a big effect? 
   Or even, maybe also only show the lines from the data points that make a big effect? But either way I think the data points should
   be the same color as the lines to make it more clear what is going on. Especially in the zoomed in plots this will be very 
   helpful.
   
5. The last plot is great. This shows a bias in the results for both, but one that is much smaller for the physical form. You should
   stress this point - even this one isn't perfect, and there is a bias, not just random uncertainties, but that you will end up with
   a better number.
